1. What are the ARP packets and what are they used for?
ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. ARP packets are used to get a MAC address, given an IP address. The RARP (Reverse ARP) does the opposite (gives an IP given a MAC).

2. What are the MAC and IP addresses of ARP packets and why?
MAC stands for Medium Access Control, and IP is Internet Protocol. An IP address is a public identifier as a numerical label used by devices to communicate in a network using the Internet Protocol. A MAC address is a unique identifier that every network card has. It is used as a network address in the data link layer.

3. What packets does the ping command generate?
The ping command sends Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets. It is used to evaluate the reachability of a host on the internet. The ping command measures the time for a round trip of a packet, reports packet loss, statistics, and errors.

4. What are the MAC and IP addresses of the ping packets?
The IP and MAC addresses of the source and destination of ping request.

5. How to determine if a receiving Ethernet frame is ARP, IP, ICMP?
In Ethernet II, by verifying the 2 bytes in the EtherType field right before the payload. The value there encodes a protocol (0x0800 for IPv4, 0x0806 for ARP, etc).

6. How to determine the length of a receiving frame?
In IEEE 802.3, the EtherType field represents the length. In Ethernet II, the physical layer detects the end of a frame. In any case, it can be seen on Wireshark and on the terminal after executing the "ping" command.

7. What is the loopback interface and why is it important?
The loopback interface is used to test if the network is well structured. The device sends itself a packet, which goes through every layer, and then returns.
